👋 Hi, I’m @ItsEricWoodward

You can find out more about me via my website, https://www.itsericwoodward.com/.

In 1997, I released my first (and so far, only) video game, [Camp Happy Island Massacre](https://www.itsericwoodward.com/chim/).

In 2016, I published the tabletop card game [Mythic Wars: Clash of the Gods](https://mythicwarsgame.com/).

In 2018, I released the [Codex Mythica](https://codex.mythicwarsgame.com/), a web app for viewing the cards from _Mythic Wars_.

In 2022, I published [The Planar Vagabond's Guide to the Multiverse](https://www.planarvagabond.com/), a set of rules, monsters, and magic items for playing a tabletop RPG based on classic D&D.

Thanks for dropping by!
